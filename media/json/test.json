"Python Tutorial\n\nThis Python tutorial has been written for the beginners to help them understand the basic to advanced concepts of Python Programming Language. After completing this tutorial, you will find yourself at a great level of expertise in Python, from where you can take yourself to the next levels to become a world class Software Engineer.\n\nWhat is Python?\n\nPython is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).\n\nPython supports multiple programming paradigms, including Procedural, Object Oriented and Functional programming language. Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.\n\nThis tutorial gives a complete understanding of Python programming language starting from basic conceopts to advanced concepts. This tutorial will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Python Programming language.\n\nPython Jobs\n\nToday, Python is very high in demand and all the major companies are looking for great Python Programmers to develop websites, software components, and applications or to work with Data Science, AI, and ML technologies. When we are developing this tutorial in 2022, there is a high shortage of Python Programmers where as market demands more number of Python Programmers due to it's application in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence etc.\n\nToday a Python Programmer with 3-5 years of experience is asking for around $150,000 annual package and this is the most demanding programming language in America. Though it can vary depending on the location of the Job. It's impossible to list all of the companies using Python, to name a few big companies are:\n\nGoogle\n\nIntel\n\nNASA\n\nPayPal\n\nFacebook\n\nIBM\n\nAmazon\n\nNetflix\n\nPinterest\n\nUber\n\nMany more...\n\nSo, you could be the next potential employee for any of these major companies. We have developed a great learning material for you to learn Python Programming which will help you prepare for the technical interviews and certification exams based on Python. So, start learning Python using this simple and effective tutorial from anywhere and anytime absolutely at your pace.\n\nWhy to Learn Python?\n\nPython is consistently rated as one of the world's most popular programming languages. Python is fairly easy to learn, so if you are starting to learn any programming language then Python could be your great choice. Today various Schools, Colleges and Universities are teaching Python as their primary programming language. There are many other good reasons which makes Python as the top choice of any programmer:\n\nPython is Open Source which means its available free of cost.\n\nPython is simple and so easy to learn\n\nPython is versatile and can be used to create many different things.\n\nPython has powerful development libraries include AI, ML etc.\n\nPython is much in demand and ensures high salary\n\nPython is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\n\nPython is Interpreted \u2212 Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n\n\u2212 Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.

Python is a Beginner's Language \u2212 Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.\n\nPython Online Compiler/Interpreter\n\nWe have provided Python Online Compiler/Interpreter which helps you to Edit and Execute the code directly from your browser. Try to click the icon to run the following Python code to print conventional \"Hello, World!\".\n\nBelow code box allows you to change the value of the code. Try to change the value inside print() and run it again to verify the result.\n\n# This is my first Python program. # This will print 'Hello, World!' as the output print (\"Hello, World!\");\n\nCareers with Python\n\nIf you know Python nicely, then you have a great career ahead. Here are just a few of the career options where Python is a key skill:\n\nGame developer\n\nWeb designer\n\nPython developer\n\nFull-stack developer\n\nMachine learning engineer\n\nData scientist\n\nData analyst\n\nData engineer\n\nDevOps engineer\n\nSoftware engineer\n\nMany more other roles\n\nCharacteristics of Python\n\nFollowing are important characteristics of Python Programming \u2212\n\nIt supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.\n\nIt can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.\n\nIt provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.\n\nIt supports automatic garbage collection.\n\nIt can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.\n\nApplications of Python\n\nThe latest release of Python is 3.x.
